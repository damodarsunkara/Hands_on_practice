📂 5. Working with File Paths
Use the os and pathlib modules.

python
Copy
Edit
import os

file_path = os.path.join("folder", "file.txt")
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
Or with pathlib:

python
Copy
Edit
from pathlib import Path

file = Path("folder/file.txt")
print(file.read_text())
🧠 6. Advanced File Handling
a. Exception Handling
python
Copy
Edit
try:
    with open("nofile.txt", "r") as file:
        print(file.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
b. Reading and Writing Binary Files
python
Copy
Edit
with open("image.png", "rb") as img_file:
    data = img_file.read()

with open("copy.png", "wb") as copy_file:
    copy_file.write(data)
c. Using seek() and tell()
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read(5))
    print(file.tell())   # Where we are in file
    file.seek(0)         # Move to start
    print(file.read(5))
🧪 7. File Object Attributes
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.name)
    print(f.mode)
    print(f.closed)
📚 Bonus: Read Large Files in Chunks
python
Copy
Edit
def read_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        while chunk := f.read(1024):  # 1KB at a time
            print(chunk)

read_large_file("largefile.txt")
