Absolutely! Let’s go through real-time file handling examples step by step, with detailed code explanations. We'll cover 3 common and practical formats:

CSV – for tabular data like spreadsheets

JSON – for structured data like settings, records

Pickle – for saving Python objects (models, data structures)

1. CSV File Handling – Use Case: Product Inventory
🧾 Goal:
Read product data from a CSV file and print product names and prices.

 Sample CSV: products.csv
arduino
Copy
Edit
ProductID,Name,Price
101,Laptop,999.99
102,Phone,499.99
103,Mouse,19.99
 Step-by-Step Code
python
Copy
Edit
import csv  # Step 1: Import the CSV module

# Step 2: Open the CSV file in read mode
with open('products.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)  # Step 3: Read each row as a dictionary

    # Step 4: Loop through the file and access values
    for row in reader:
        print(f"Product: {row['Name']}, Price: ${row['Price']}")
 Explanation:
import csv: Enables handling of CSV files.

open('products.csv', 'r'): Opens the file for reading.

csv.DictReader(file): Reads each line and converts it into a dictionary using the header row as keys.

row['Name']: Accesses the value for the “Name” column.

print(...): Outputs product name and price clearly.

 2. JSON File Handling – Use Case: Patient Record System
🧾 Goal:
Read patient records from a JSON file and display their name and condition.

🔹 Sample JSON: patients.json
json
Copy
Edit
[
  {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "condition": "Healthy"},
  {"name": "Bob", "age": 45, "condition": "Diabetes"}
]
 Step-by-Step Code
python
Copy
Edit
import json  # Step 1: Import the JSON module

# Step 2: Open JSON file in read mode
with open('patients.json', 'r') as file:
    patients = json.load(file)  # Step 3: Load JSON content into Python list

# Step 4: Loop through patient records
for patient in patients:
    print(f"{patient['name']} is {patient['age']} years old and has {patient['condition']}.")
 Explanation:
import json: Lets Python work with JSON files.

open(..., 'r'): Opens the file for reading.

json.load(...): Converts JSON data into Python objects (list of dictionaries).

Loop iterates over each patient dictionary and prints their details.

3. Pickle File Handling – Use Case: Saving a Python Dictionary
🧾 Goal:
Save a Python dictionary to a file, and then read it back.

 Step-by-Step Code
python
Copy
Edit
import pickle  # Step 1: Import pickle for object serialization

# Step 2: Data to save
data = {'name': 'John', 'scores': [95, 87, 92]}

# Step 3: Save object to file in binary mode
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(data, file)  # Saves Python object to file
Explanation (Writing):
import pickle: Used to serialize Python objects.

open('data.pkl', 'wb'): Opens a file in write-binary mode.

pickle.dump(data, file): Converts data into binary and saves it.
 Now: Read it back
python
Copy
Edit
# Step 4: Load object from file
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    loaded_data = pickle.load(file)

# Step 5: Use the loaded data
print(f"Name: {loaded_data['name']}")
print(f"Scores: {loaded_data['scores']}")
Explanation (Reading):
open('data.pkl', 'rb'): Opens the file in read-binary mode.

pickle.load(...): Deserializes the binary back into a Python dictionary.

We then access keys just like normal Python dictionaries.

🏁 Summary Table
Format	Best For	Module	File Type	Serialization
CSV	Tabular data (Excel)	csv	.csv	No
JSON	Configs, Records	json	.json	Yes (Text)
Pickle	Python-only objects	pickle	.pkl	Yes (Binary)
