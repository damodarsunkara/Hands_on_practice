
You are building an online shopping website.
Customers can pay in different ways: Credit Card, PayPal, UPI, etc.

You don’t want to write separate code for each payment type everywhere. Instead, you want one abstract payment method that hides the complex details.

🔹 What is abc?
abc stands for Abstract Base Classes.
It’s a built-in Python module that provides tools to create abstract classes and methods.

🔹 Why import ABC and abstractmethod?
You import them to:

ABC: Mark a class as abstract.

abstractmethod: Mark a method as abstract (no code, must be overridden).

You only need to import them in the file where you’re defining an abstract c
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):
        pass  # No implementation here — each method will define its own

class CreditCard(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paying ₹{amount} using Credit Card.")

class PayPal(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paying ₹{amount} using PayPal.")

class UPI(PaymentMethod):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paying ₹{amount} using UPI.")
def complete_payment(payment: PaymentMethod, amount):
    payment.pay(amount)  # We don't care how it pays — just that it can

# Examples
complete_payment(CreditCard(), 500)
complete_payment(PayPal(), 250)
complete_payment(UPI(), 100)
Paying ₹500 using Credit Card.
Paying ₹250 using PayPal.
Paying ₹100 using UPI.


🔹 What Is Duck Typing?
In Python:

“If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”

That means:

Python doesn’t care what type an object is.

If it has the method you want and it works — go ahead and use it!

This is called duck typing: behavior matters more than the class.


def complete_payment(payment: PaymentMethod, amount):
This is a function definition in Python. Let’s break it down piece by piece:

1. def complete_payment(...)
This defines a function named complete_payment.

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

2. (payment: PaymentMethod, amount)
Inside the parentheses are parameters — inputs the function expects.

payment: This parameter expects an object that is (or behaves like) a PaymentMethod.

amount: This parameter expects a number representing how much money to pay.
3. What does payment: PaymentMethod mean?
This is called a type hint or type annotation.

It tells Python (and humans reading the code) that payment should be an instance of the PaymentMethod class or a subclass of it.

This helps tools and editors check your code but doesn’t stop the program if you pass something else (Python is still dynamically typed).

. What happens inside the function?
python
Copy code
payment.pay(amount)
The function calls the .pay() method of the payment object.

Since payment should be a PaymentMethod, it must have a .pay() method (because PaymentMethod declares it as abstract).

This means you can pass in a CreditCard(), UPI(), or PayPal() object — all have their own .pay() method, and this function calls the right one dynamically.

Why is this useful?
You can write one function that handles any payment method without caring about the details.

This uses polymorphism: the same method call .pay() behaves differently depending on the object passed.
